# CI/CD & Deployment Setup Summary

## 🚀 Implementation Complete

All three requested components have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows

**Location**: `.github/workflows/`

- **ci.yml** - Enhanced CI pipeline with coverage thresholds, security auditing
- **codeql.yml** - Comprehensive security analysis with security-and-quality queries  
- **dependency-review.yml** - Automated dependency vulnerability and license compliance checking
- **release.yml** - Production deployment pipeline with changelog generation
- **preview-deploy.yml** - Ephemeral preview environments for pull requests
- **e2e.yml** - End-to-end testing with Playwright

**Key Features:**
- Coverage threshold enforcement (70% minimum)
- Security vulnerability scanning with fail conditions
- Automated dependency updates via enhanced dependabot
- Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- OIDC authentication for Azure (no static secrets)

### ✅ 2. Bicep Infrastructure Skeleton

**Location**: `infra/`

**Modular Architecture:**
- `main.bicep` - Orchestration template
- `modules/static-web-app.bicep` - Frontend hosting
- `modules/functions.bicep` - Backend API (Node.js 20)
- `modules/key-vault.bicep` - Secret management with GitHub App keys
- `modules/storage.bicep` - Audit trails and export storage
- `modules/app-insights.bicep` - Observability and dashboards

**Environment Support:**
- `parameters/dev.parameters.json` - Development configuration
- `parameters/prod.parameters.json` - Production configuration

**Azure Resources:**
- Static Web Apps (global CDN, staging slots)
- Azure Functions (managed auth proxy, audit logging)
- Key Vault (GitHub App private key, secrets)  
- Storage Account (Table + Blob for audit trails)
- Application Insights (pre-built workbooks, metrics)

### ✅ 3. Comprehensive Documentation

**Architecture Documentation** (`docs/architecture.md`):
- System architecture with flow diagrams
- Security model and authentication flows
- Scalability and performance considerations
- Compliance features and audit trails
- Monitoring and disaster recovery

**Azure Deployment Guide** (`docs/azure-deployment.md`):
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- GitHub App setup and configuration
- OIDC authentication setup
- Environment-specific configurations
- Troubleshooting and monitoring queries
- Security checklist and compliance requirements

### 🔧 Additional Enhancements

**Playwright E2E Testing:**
- Complete smoke test suite (`tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`)
- Mocked GitHub API responses for reliable testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chromium, Firefox, Safari)

**Enhanced Package Configuration:**
- Added Playwright dependency and scripts
- E2E test commands (`npm run test:e2e`, `test:e2e:ui`)
- CI-ready test reporting (JUnit, HTML, Line)

**Dependabot Configuration:**
- Enhanced security-focused dependency management
- Grouped updates for related packages (ESLint, TypeScript, Vite, etc.)
- GitHub Actions security updates
- Automated merge for dev dependencies

## 🚦 Quick Start Commands

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Testing
```bash
npm run test          # Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests
npm run lint          # Code quality checks
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript validation
```

### Azure Deployment
```bash
# Infrastructure
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group rg-codeql-compliance-dev \
  --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters infra/parameters/dev.parameters.json

# Application (via GitHub Actions)
git push origin main  # Triggers CI/CD pipeline
```

## 🔐 Required Secrets Setup

**GitHub Repository Secrets:**
```bash
AZURE_CLIENT_ID          # Service principal for OIDC
AZURE_TENANT_ID          # Azure AD tenant
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID    # Azure subscription
AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN  # SWA deployment token
```

**Azure Key Vault Secrets:**
```bash
github-app-id            # GitHub App ID  
github-installation-id   # Installation ID
github-app-private-key   # Private key (PEM format)
```

## 🔑 GitHub Personal Access Token Requirements

**For Local Development & Manual Operations:**

### Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) - Required Scopes:
- `repo` - Full control of private repositories (required for repository access)
- `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows (required for workflow dispatch)

### Fine-grained Personal Access Token - Required Permissions:
- **Actions**: Read and write (enables workflow dispatch)
- **Contents**: Read (enables repository content access)
- **Pull requests**: Read (if using PR-related features)

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **403 "Resource not accessible by personal access token"**: Missing `workflow` scope on classic PAT or insufficient Actions permissions on fine-grained PAT
- **403 "Workflow dispatch failed"**: Repository Actions settings may be set to "Read" only - change to "Read and write" in Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions
- **Organization SSO**: If using organization repositories, ensure your PAT is authorized for SSO via Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens

### Testing Your Token:
```bash
# Test workflow dispatch permissions
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID/dispatches \
  -d '{"ref":"main"}'
```
Expected response: HTTP 204 (success) or specific error guidance.

## 📊 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

```
Pull Request → CI (lint/test/build) → Preview Deploy → Review
     ↓
Main Branch → CI → Staging Deploy → Integration Tests  
     ↓
Tagged Release → Production Deploy → Smoke Tests → Success
```
