- **Security Visualization**: Display live security alerts categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Note)
- **Audit Trail Dashboard**: Complete historical view of scan requests with GitHub workflow correlation
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate FedRAMP-ready reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic status updates and scan result synchronization
- **Enterprise Security**: Token validation, rate limiting awareness, and permission-based access control

## Getting started

There are multiple ways to get started with this project. The quickest way is to clone the repository and run it locally.

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools to work on your local machine:

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with these scopes:
  - `repo` - Full repository access
  - `security_events` - Read security events
  - `actions:read` - Read GitHub Actions workflows
  - `metadata:read` - Read repository metadata

### Use your local environment

Then you can get the project code:

1. **Fork** the project to create your own copy of this repository
2. Clone your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd codeql-compliance-da
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### (Optional) System configuration via environment variables

If you prefer not to enter your GitHub token through the UI (or you are running in an environment where the original Spark KV storage hook was unreliable), you can pre-configure the connection using a local environment file. The app now uses a resilient localStorage-backed persistence layer by default, with environment variables as an optional override:

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root (it's already ignored by `.gitignore` via the `*.local` pattern).
2. Add the following variables (do NOT commit this file):

   ```bash
   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_pat_here
   VITE_GITHUB_ORG=your-org-name
   ```

3. Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`). The application will detect these values and mark the GitHub connection as established. The Setup tab will display the connection as ‚Äúenvironment managed‚Äù and disable manual edits until you remove the variables.

> [!CAUTION]
> Storing long‚Äëlived PATs in local `.env.local` is convenient but still sensitive. Prefer fine‚Äëscoped tokens and rotate regularly. For production deployments use a secure secret manager rather than embedding values at build time.

## Run the application

### Local development

After installation, you can start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built application will be in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### GitHub API integration

The application integrates with several GitHub APIs:

- **Organizations API**: Repository discovery and metadata
- **Actions API**: Workflow dispatch and run status tracking
- **Code Scanning API**: Security alert retrieval and analysis
- **Repository API**: Workflow file detection and validation

### Default vs Advanced CodeQL Setup & On-Demand Scanning

This dashboard supports both GitHub's **Default Setup** and **Advanced Setup** configurations for CodeQL:

#### Default Setup
- **Automatic Configuration**: GitHub automatically configures CodeQL analysis with sensible defaults
- **Limited Customization**: Cannot customize query suites, languages, or scheduling
- **No On-Demand Scanning**: Does not support `workflow_dispatch` triggers for manual scan initiation
- **Best For**: Quick setup with minimal configuration requirements

#### Advanced Setup
- **Full Control**: Custom workflow files (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) with complete configuration control
- **Customizable**: Select specific languages, query suites, and scan scheduling
- **On-Demand Support**: Supports `workflow_dispatch` triggers enabling manual scan requests via this dashboard
- **Best For**: Organizations requiring compliance auditing and on-demand scanning capabilities

#### Security Considerations

**Current Implementation (Client PAT)**:
- Uses Personal Access Tokens stored in browser local storage
- Direct client-side API calls to GitHub
- **Risk**: Token exposure in client-side code and storage

**Planned Migration (GitHub App + Azure Functions)**:
- Implement GitHub App authentication with restricted permissions
- Server-side token exchange via Azure Functions
- Short-lived installation access tokens (1-hour expiry)
- Enhanced security with organization-level control
- **Benefit**: Eliminates client-side token storage and reduces attack surface

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Notice**: The current Personal Access Token approach is suitable for development and internal use. For production deployments, migrate to the GitHub App + Azure Functions architecture to meet enterprise security standards.

#### Repository Compatibility

| Setup Type | SARIF Retrieval | On-Demand Scanning | Dashboard Support |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Default Setup | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ùå Not Available | ‚ö†Ô∏è Read-Only |
| Advanced Setup | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full |
| No Setup | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå Not Available | ‚ùå Not Supported |

**Migration Path**: To enable on-demand scanning for Default Setup repositories:
1. Disable Default Setup in repository security settings
2. Add `.github/workflows/codeql-advanced.yml` with `workflow_dispatch` trigger
3. Configure languages and query suites as needed
4. Verify workflow dispatch permissions in repository settings

  - `actions:read` - Read GitHub Actions workflows
  - `metadata:read` - Read repository metadata

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codeql-compliance-da.git
   cd codeql-compliance-da
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**

   ```bash

## üé® Design System

The dashboard follows enterprise-grade design principles with a professional color scheme:

- **Primary**: Deep Blue (`oklch(0.4 0.15 240)`) - Conveys trust and security
- **Accent**: Alert Orange (`oklch(0.65 0.18 45)`) - For actions requiring attention
- **Typography**: Inter font family for technical precision and readability
- **Components**: Consistent 16px base spacing with accessible contrast ratios

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability

### Current Optimizations

- **Concurrent API Requests**: GitHub API calls use controlled concurrency (4-6 simultaneous requests)
- **In-Memory Caching**: 60-second TTL for repository metadata and workflows
- **Rate Limit Management**: Automatic backoff and retry with remaining quota tracking
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes are code-split for optimal bundle size

### Known Limitations

- **Repository List**: Currently loads all repositories at once (synchronous pagination)
- **Concurrent Limit**: Conservative concurrency limits to avoid secondary rate limits

### Scalability Roadmap

- **üöÄ Repository Virtualization**: For organizations with >500 repositories
  - Implement windowed rendering using `@tanstack/react-virtual`
  - Lazy load repository metadata on scroll
  - Estimated improvement: Handle 5000+ repositories with minimal memory impact
  
- **üìä Advanced Caching**: Server-side caching layer
  - Redis/Azure Cache for Redis integration
  - Stale-while-revalidate patterns
  - 10x reduction in GitHub API calls

- **‚ö° GraphQL Migration**: Batch operations for improved efficiency
  - Replace REST API calls with GitHub GraphQL API v4
  - Single request for multiple repository metadata
  - Estimated 60% reduction in API request count

### Environment Variables for Performance Tuning

```bash
# Adjust concurrency limits (development only)
GITHUB_MAX_CONCURRENT=8        # Default: 5
GITHUB_CACHE_TTL=120000        # Default: 60000ms (60s)
```
