## ISTQB Framework Application

### Test Design Techniques Used

#### ✅ Equivalence Partitioning
- **Webhook event types**: `workflow_run`, `code_scanning_alert`, `push`, `security_advisory`
- **Repository states**: `success`, `failure`, `in_progress`, `pending`
- **Security severity levels**: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `note`
- **WebSocket connection states**: `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, `disconnected`, `error`

#### ✅ Boundary Value Analysis
- **Payload size limits**: 
  - Just under limit: 25MB - 1000 bytes ✓
  - At limit: exactly 25MB ✓
  - Over limit: 25MB + 1000 bytes ✓
- **Rate limiting boundaries**:
  - Within limit: 999/1000 requests ✓
  - At limit: exactly 1000 requests ✓
  - Over limit: 1001+ requests ✓
- **Connection timeout thresholds**:
  - Before timeout: response in 14.9s ✓
  - At timeout: exactly 15s ✓
  - After timeout: no response after 15.1s ✓

#### ✅ Decision Table Testing
- **Authentication combinations and webhook routing logic**
  - Valid signature + valid payload = Process ✓
  - Valid signature + invalid payload = Reject ✓
  - Invalid signature + valid payload = Reject ✓
  - Invalid signature + invalid payload = Reject ✓
- **Event action routing**:
  - `workflow_run` + `completed` + `success` = Update scan status to success ✓
  - `workflow_run` + `completed` + `failure` = Update scan status to failure ✓
  - `code_scanning_alert` + `created` = Increment security findings ✓
  - `code_scanning_alert` + `closed_by_user` = Decrement security findings ✓

#### ✅ State Transition Testing
- **WebSocket connection lifecycle**:
  - `disconnected` → `connecting` → `connected` ✓
  - `connected` → `disconnected` (clean shutdown) ✓
  - `connected` → `reconnecting` → `connected` (recovery) ✓
  - `connecting` → `error` → `disconnected` (failed connection) ✓
- **Repository scan states**:
  - `pending` → `in_progress` → `success` ✓
  - `pending` → `in_progress` → `failure` ✓
  - `success` → `in_progress` (new scan) ✓

#### ✅ Experience-Based Testing
- **Network failure scenarios**:
  - Intermittent connectivity ✓
  - DNS resolution failure ✓
  - SSL/TLS handshake failure ✓
  - Gateway timeout ✓
  - Connection refused ✓
- **Common webhook issues**:
  - Duplicate event delivery ✓
  - Out-of-order event processing ✓
  - Malformed JSON payloads ✓
  - Missing or incorrect headers ✓
