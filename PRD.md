## Essential Features

### GitHub Organization Integration
- **Functionality**: Connect to GitHub organizations with Personal Access Token authentication
- **Purpose**: Enable real-time repository management and CodeQL workflow dispatch
- **Trigger**: Initial setup and configuration management
- **Progression**: Enter GitHub token → Verify organization access → Test API permissions → Establish connection → Load repositories
- **Success criteria**: Successful authentication and repository list populated from live GitHub data

### Repository Management
- **Functionality**: Display repositories from connected GitHub organization with CodeQL workflow detection
- **Purpose**: Provide visibility into scan-ready repositories for compliance auditing
- **Trigger**: GitHub connection established and manual refresh
- **Progression**: Load dashboard → Fetch GitHub repos via API → Detect CodeQL workflows → Display with real-time status
- **Success criteria**: All repositories with workflow_dispatch CodeQL workflows are listed with current scan status

### On-Demand Scan Dispatch
- **Functionality**: Trigger live CodeQL scans via GitHub workflow dispatch API with real-time status tracking
- **Purpose**: Meet FedRAMP requirements for immediate security scanning capability
- **Trigger**: Click "Request Scan" button on repository card
- **Progression**: Select repo → Confirm scan request → GitHub API workflow dispatch → Track progress → Update scan results
- **Success criteria**: GitHub workflow successfully triggered and results automatically updated in dashboard

### Scan Results Visualization
- **Functionality**: Display live CodeQL security alerts and findings from GitHub Code Scanning API
- **Purpose**: Provide immediate visibility into current security posture for audit documentation
- **Trigger**: Repository connection or scan completion
- **Progression**: Connect to repo → Fetch live CodeQL alerts → Parse security severity levels → Display categorized chart
- **Success criteria**: Real security findings accurately categorized and displayed from GitHub's Code Scanning alerts

### Audit Trail Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Historical view of all scan dispatch requests with GitHub workflow tracking
- **Purpose**: Maintain compliance documentation for FedRAMP auditing with real workflow data
- **Trigger**: Navigate to audit tab
- **Progression**: Access audit view → Load historical scan requests → Cross-reference with GitHub workflow runs → Display timeline
- **Success criteria**: Complete audit trail with GitHub workflow correlation meets FedRAMP documentation requirements

## Edge Case Handling
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for GitHub API calls with proper error handling
- **Invalid GitHub Tokens**: Clear error messaging when tokens are expired or have insufficient permissions
- **Workflow Failures**: Display clear error states when CodeQL workflows fail to dispatch with GitHub error details
- **Missing Permissions**: Graceful handling when user lacks repository or security_events access with permission guidance
- **Organization Access**: Handle cases where user cannot access specified organization with clear messaging
- **Network Timeouts**: Offline indicators and connection retry logic for unreliable GitHub API access
- **Large Repository Sets**: Pagination and loading states for enterprises with 100+ repositories
- **Workflow Detection**: Handle repositories without CodeQL workflows or workflow_dispatch capability

## Design Direction
The design should feel authoritative and enterprise-grade, conveying security and compliance professionalism. Clean, structured interface with generous whitespace and clear information hierarchy that builds trust in critical security data.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using professional blues and strategic red accents to communicate security states clearly while maintaining corporate professionalism.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)) - Conveys trust, security, and enterprise reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Gray (oklch(0.96 0.01 240)) for backgrounds, Mid Gray (oklch(0.7 0.02 240)) for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Alert Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) for scan requests and critical actions requiring attention
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 16.5:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.005 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.4 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Alert Orange oklch(0.65 0.18 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should project authority and clarity with excellent readability for data-dense interfaces, using Inter for its technical precision and professional appearance.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Dashboard Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Data Tables): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Timestamps): Inter Regular/12px/muted color

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that reinforce data updates and state changes without interfering with rapid information consumption during security reviews.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions communicate data freshness and system responsiveness, critical for security monitoring tools
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Scan status indicators and refresh actions deserve subtle animation focus, while data tables remain stable
