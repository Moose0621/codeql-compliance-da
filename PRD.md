# Enterprise CodeQL Security Dashboard

A comprehensive security compliance dashboard for managing and monitoring CodeQL workflow dispatches across enterprise repositories to meet FedRAMP audit requirements with on-demand scanning capabilities.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Professional** - Clean, authoritative interface that conveys enterprise security standards
2. **Efficient** - Quick access to critical security data with minimal cognitive load
3. **Trustworthy** - Clear visual hierarchy and reliable data presentation that builds confidence

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- Integrates with GitHub APIs for repository management and CodeQL workflow dispatch
- Requires sophisticated state management for scan results and audit trails
- Multi-level data visualization with real-time status monitoring

## Essential Features

### Repository Management
- **Functionality**: Display repositories configured with advanced CodeQL workflow dispatch
- **Purpose**: Provide visibility into scan-ready repositories for compliance auditing
- **Trigger**: Dashboard load and manual refresh
- **Progression**: Load dashboard → Fetch GitHub repos → Filter CodeQL-enabled → Display in sortable table
- **Success criteria**: All repositories with workflow_dispatch CodeQL workflows are listed with status indicators

### On-Demand Scan Dispatch
- **Functionality**: Trigger CodeQL scans via workflow dispatch with 2-3 minute SLA
- **Purpose**: Meet FedRAMP requirements for immediate security scanning capability
- **Trigger**: Click "Request Scan" button on repository row
- **Progression**: Select repo → Confirm scan request → API call to GitHub → Show progress indicator → Update scan status
- **Success criteria**: Workflow dispatch successfully triggers and status updates within expected timeframe

### Scan Results Visualization
- **Functionality**: Display latest CodeQL results with security findings breakdown
- **Purpose**: Provide immediate visibility into security posture for audit documentation
- **Trigger**: Repository selection or automatic refresh
- **Progression**: Select repository → Fetch latest CodeQL results → Parse findings → Display categorized results chart
- **Success criteria**: Security findings are accurately categorized and visually represented

### Audit Trail Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Historical view of all scan requests and completion times
- **Purpose**: Maintain compliance documentation for FedRAMP auditing
- **Trigger**: Navigate to audit tab
- **Progression**: Access audit view → Load historical scan data → Display timeline with filters
- **Success criteria**: Complete audit trail with timestamps meets FedRAMP documentation requirements

## Edge Case Handling
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for GitHub API calls
- **Workflow Failures**: Display clear error states when CodeQL workflows fail to dispatch
- **Missing Permissions**: Graceful handling when user lacks repository access with clear messaging
- **Network Timeouts**: Offline indicators and cached data display for unreliable connections
- **Large Repository Sets**: Pagination and virtual scrolling for enterprises with 100+ repositories

## Design Direction
The design should feel authoritative and enterprise-grade, conveying security and compliance professionalism. Clean, structured interface with generous whitespace and clear information hierarchy that builds trust in critical security data.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using professional blues and strategic red accents to communicate security states clearly while maintaining corporate professionalism.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)) - Conveys trust, security, and enterprise reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Gray (oklch(0.96 0.01 240)) for backgrounds, Mid Gray (oklch(0.7 0.02 240)) for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Alert Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) for scan requests and critical actions requiring attention
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 16.5:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.005 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.4 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Alert Orange oklch(0.65 0.18 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should project authority and clarity with excellent readability for data-dense interfaces, using Inter for its technical precision and professional appearance.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Dashboard Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Data Tables): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Timestamps): Inter Regular/12px/muted color

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that reinforce data updates and state changes without interfering with rapid information consumption during security reviews.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions communicate data freshness and system responsiveness, critical for security monitoring tools
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Scan status indicators and refresh actions deserve subtle animation focus, while data tables remain stable
