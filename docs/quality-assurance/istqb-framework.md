# ISTQB Framework Application

## Test Process Activities Implementation

### 1. Test Planning and Control

#### Risk-Based Test Planning
- **High-Risk Areas Identified:**
  - GitHub API integrations (rate limiting, authentication)
  - Repository filtering with 1000+ repositories
  - Real-time webhook processing
  - CodeQL workflow dispatch reliability
  
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Comprehensive API mocking and error simulation
  - Performance testing with large datasets
  - Fault injection testing for resilience
  - End-to-end workflow validation

#### Resource Allocation
- **QA Lead**: Overall quality coordination and risk assessment
- **Security Tester**: Webhook security and external integration validation
- **Performance Tester**: Load testing and performance optimization
- **Accessibility Specialist**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design validation
- **Automation Engineer**: CI/CD integration and test automation framework

#### Test Schedule Coordination
| Phase | Duration | Activities | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Foundation** | 2 days | Quality framework setup, baseline metrics | Current codebase analysis |
| **Enhancement** | 5 days | Test coverage expansion, performance benchmarks | Feature implementation complete |
| **Validation** | 3 days | Security testing, accessibility validation | All tests implemented |
| **Integration** | 2 days | CI/CD integration, automated quality gates | Infrastructure ready |

#### Tool Selection
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (existing)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright with cross-browser support (existing)
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest integration
- **Security Testing**: npm audit, Snyk, OWASP ZAP
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core, Pa11y
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript, SonarQube integration

### 2. Test Analysis and Design

#### Test Basis Analysis
- [x] PRD review: Enterprise CodeQL Security Dashboard requirements
- [x] Technical specifications: React 19, TypeScript, GitHub API integration
- [x] Acceptance criteria: Repository management, scan dispatch, audit trail
- [ ] Security requirements: Authentication, data protection, API security
- [ ] Performance requirements: 1000+ repositories, <200ms filtering
- [ ] Accessibility requirements: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

#### Test Condition Identification
**Advanced Repository Filtering:**
- Functional: Search, filter combinations, result accuracy
- Performance: Response time with large datasets
- Usability: Filter interface, result presentation

**Real-time Webhook Integration:**
- Functional: Event processing, status updates, error handling
- Security: Authentication, payload validation, rate limiting
- Reliability: Message delivery, retry mechanisms

**Enhanced Notification System:**
- Functional: Notification delivery, customization, persistence
- Compatibility: Cross-browser notifications, mobile support
- Usability: Notification management, user preferences

#### Test Case Design Techniques (ISTQB)
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Repository count ranges (0, 1-100, 100-1000, 1000+)
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Search result limits, API rate limits
- **Decision Table Testing**: Filter combinations and expected results
- **State Transition Testing**: Workflow dispatch states, notification states
- **Use Case Testing**: End-to-end user scenarios

#### Test Data Design
- **Representative Data**: Mock GitHub repositories with varied characteristics
- **Edge Cases**: Empty repositories, large repositories, special characters
- **Security Test Data**: Invalid tokens, malformed payloads, injection attempts
- **Performance Test Data**: Datasets of 100, 1000, 5000+ repositories

### 3. Test Implementation and Execution

#### Test Environment Setup
- **Development**: Local environment with mocked GitHub API
- **Staging**: Production-like environment with test GitHub organization
- **Performance**: Isolated environment for load testing
- **Security**: Dedicated security testing environment

#### Test Execution Strategy
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent test suites run simultaneously
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: High-risk areas tested first
- **Smoke Testing**: Critical functionality verified before full testing
- **Regression Testing**: Automated tests for unchanged functionality

#### Defect Management Process
- **Severity Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Priority Assignment**: P0 (Blocker), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low)
- **Tracking**: GitHub Issues with standardized labels
- **Escalation**: Defined escalation path for critical issues

### 4. Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting

#### Quality Metrics Analysis
- **Coverage Metrics**: Statement, branch, function coverage >90%
- **Defect Density**: <1 defect per 100 lines of new code
- **Performance Metrics**: All benchmarks within acceptable range
- **Security Metrics**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities

#### Risk Assessment Framework
- **Remaining Risks**: Identified and documented with mitigation plans
- **Quality Confidence**: Statistical analysis of test results
- **Release Readiness**: Go/No-Go decision criteria

#### Test Summary Reporting
- **Executive Summary**: High-level quality assessment
- **Detailed Results**: Test execution results by feature area
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Visual representation of quality metrics
- **Recommendations**: Action items for quality improvement
